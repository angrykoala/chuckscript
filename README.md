Chuck Norris Programming Language
=================================
_by @demiurgosoft_     
Chuck Norris can code using binary without 1, with Chuck Norris Programming Language (**CNPL**)you also can!. For those who think assembler is a high level language.

## Syntax
The syntax is probably the most easy to learn: `0` is the only command you'll need Â¿What does `0` do? Everything.

## High Level CNPL
Chuck Norris code is so powerful that no current machine can process it, so a higher abstraction was made to make the code comprehensible for us:    
`[0]{12}` means _"twelve zeroes"_ and is the High Level CNPL which is translated into: `000000000000` into pure Chuck Norris Code

## Hello World!
CNPL is fully functional, based on JavaScript. To start coding, just tweak this simple hello world:
```
[0]{9582516168086304533950061199088375933762201813077804024987245718616842}
```
_CNPL for hello world!_


## CNI
CNI (_Chuck Norris Interpreter_) is the official CNPL interpreter and allows you to execute CNPL (extension .cnpl) in your machine.

To use it, just install dependencies with npm:    
```
npm install
```

Then, execute with the file you want to execute:
```
node cni.js myprogram.cnpl
```

## CNGEN
Of course, CNPL is the only language you'll ever need again, however, to start learning it cni also brings a cnpl code generator, which will convert your old, inefficient and un-epic JavaScript code into a bright new CNPL code, to use it:
```
node cngen.js myoldjs.js newsupercode.cnpl
```


## CNPL Code
In the folder `/example_code` you'll find some ready-to-use examples of cnpl code
