Chuck Norris Programming Language
=================================
_by @demiurgosoft_     
Chuck Norris can code using binary without 1, with Chuck Norris Programming Language (**CNPL**) you also can!. For those who think assembler is a high level language.

## Syntax
The syntax is probably the easiest to learn: `0` is the only command you'll need. What does `0` do? Everything.

## ChuckScript
Chuck Norris code is so powerful that no current machine can process it, so a higher abstraction was made to make the code comprehensible for humans (and machines):    
`[0]{12}` means _"twelve zeroes"_ and it is translated `000000000000` in pure Chuck Norris Code.

All ChuckScripts allow comments, and only the first command with the syntax `[0]{...}` will be executed. The extension is `.cnpl`

## Hello World!
CNPL is fully functional, based on JavaScript. To start coding, just tweak this simple hello world:
```
[0]{9582516168086304533950061199088375933762201813077804024987245718616842}
```
_hellow_world.cnpl_

## CNI
CNI (_Chuck Norris Interpreter_) is the official CNPL interpreter and allows you to execute CNPL (extension .cnpl) in your machine.

To use it, just install dependencies with npm:    
```
npm install
```

Then, execute with the file you want to execute:
```
node cni.js myprogram.cnpl
```

## CNGEN
Of course, CNPL is the only language you'll ever need again, however, to start learning it cni also brings a cnpl code generator, which will convert your old, un-epic JavaScript code into a bright new CNPL code, to use it:
```
node cngen.js myoldjs.js newsupercode.cnpl
```

## Examples
In the folder `/examples` you'll find some ready-to-use examples of cnpl code:

* **hello_world.cnpl:** The proper way to start learning a new language, with a easy-to-learn hello world
* **loop.cnpl:** Learn the easy loop syntax of ChuckScript with this example
* **sever.cnpl:** ChuckScript is web-development ready, in this example you will learn how to make your own server
