Chuck Norris Programming Language
=================================
_by @demiurgosoft_
Chuck Norris can code using binary without 1, with Chuck Norris Programming Language (**CNPL**)you also can!. For those who think assembler is a high level language.

## Syntax
The syntax is probably the most easy to learn: `0` is the only command you'll need Â¿What does `0` do? Everything.

## High Level CNPL
Chuck Norris code is so powerfull that no current machine can process it, so a higher abstraction was made to make the code comprehensible for us:
`[0]{12}` means _"twelve ceroes"_ and is the High Level CNPL wich is translated into: `000000000000` into pure Chuck Norris Code

## Hello World!
CNPL is fully functional, based on javascript. To start coding, just tweak this simple hello world:
```
[0]{9582516168086304533950061199088375933762201813077804024987245718616842}
```
_CNPL for hello world!_
